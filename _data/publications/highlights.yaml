- title: Hot atomic vapors for nonlinear and quantum optics
  image: review.png
  description:
    A general review to discuss all the cool physics done with hot atomic
    vapors. It goes from conventional non-linear wave-mixing to squeezing, quantum
    memories and more recent topics about quantum fluids of light.

- title: Quantum Vacuum Excitation of a Quasinormal Mode in an Analog Model of Black
    Hole Spacetime
  image: qnm.png
  description: 
    Vacuum fluctuations near horizons are known to yield correlated emission by the Hawking effect.
    These quantum fluctuations then excite the horizon mode and make it ring like a bell.
    These are the quasi-normal modes of the black holes that resonate.

# - title: Spectrum of collective excitations of a quantum fluid of polaritons
#   image: bragg_polariton2.png
#   description: 
#     An exploration of collective excitations with our novel spectroscopy techniques. 
#     Dispersion relation is more complex than standard Bogoliubov dispersion in driven-dissipative systems.

- title: Analogue cosmological particle creation in an ultracold quantum fluid of
    light
  image: analogue.png
  description: 
    Fluids of light in the paraxial geometry are intrinsically out-of-equilibrium.
    We explore the role of the interaction quench on the structure factor of our 
    fluid and we make connection with cosmological particle creation.



- title: High-Resolution Coherent Probe Spectroscopy of a Polariton Quantum Fluid
  image: bragg_polariton1.png
  description: 
    A promising spectroscopy technique to measure the dispersion relation of a Polariton Quantum Fluid
    even at very low momenta, and with access to the ghost (negative energy) modes.

- title: Nonequilibrium Prethermal States in a Two-Dimensional Photon Fluid
  image: murad.png
  description: 
    We excite a quantum fluids of light with a bit of kinetic energy (associated to a temperature)
    and we study the quasi long range order (algebraic coherence) to explore phase transition in
    non-equilibrium state in collaboration with Nicolas Cherroret.

- title: Measurement of the Static Structure Factor in a Paraxial Fluid of Light Using
    Bragg-like Spectroscopy
  image: bragg_rb.png
  description:
    Fluids of light in the propagating geometry is quite a new field. A lot of common techniques of 
    cold atoms are missing. We found a way to perform Bragg-like spectroscopy and measure the structure
    factor in a fluid of light.

- title: Quantitative Analysis of Shock Wave Dynamics in a Fluid of Light
  image: shock.png
  description:
    Fluids of light are a nice platform to test analytical theory for 1D and 2D non-linear physics.
    Here we check shock waves in and we propose an analytical model in collaboration with the group of Nicolas Pavloff.

- title: Observation of the Bogoliubov Dispersion in a Fluid of Light
  image: paraxial.png
  description: 
    Our first paper about fluids of light in the propagating geometry. We took quantum fluids of light analogy seriously and we realized that they
    are actually superfluids ! The beginning of a long journey...
