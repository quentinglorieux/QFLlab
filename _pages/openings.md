# Join Us

We are a group of **friendly and welcoming scientists** and we aim to create an **inclusive and supportive research environment**. We strongly believe in the value of diversity and inclusion in the field of quantum physics and we encourage women and/or individuals from underrepresented minority groups to apply.
**We are currently looking for new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team.**

In the group, we work on the grand challenges of quantum gases without the *experimental complexity* of ultra-cold atoms setups. We conduct projects at the interface of instrumental design and novel physics. By joining the group, you will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, simulating and analyzing the data, and making discoveries.

### Current Job offers
 - **ERC Postdoc** : 2-3 years ERC postdoc position on quantum fluids of light and syntheric photonic matter.

### Applications for Master 2, PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are in Master 2 and are interested in **working with us as a PhD student**, please send me an [email](mailto:quentin.glorieux@lkb.upmc.fr). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as in Master 1. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. 

We welcome applications from postdocs **with or without fellowships**. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the the Marie Curie fellowship. In many country, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs.


### Bsc / Master 1 students
If you are interested in pursuing a Master 1 internship please contact [me](mailto:quentin.glorieux@lkb.upmc.fr) and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. 
Sometimes, we take BSc students for summer internships, but only if we get exceptional applicants.
