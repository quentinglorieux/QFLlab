We explore **Quantum Optics** through the prism of **degenerate quantum gases**.<br>
Our goal is to mix optics and atomic physics to explore
superfluidity, turbulence and quantum simulation with **Quantum Fluids of Light (QFL)**.

At the intersection of quantum physics and optics, we focus on **quantum fluids of light within warm or cold atomic clouds**. By probing the novel observables offered by the quantum optics toolbox, we study light at the quantum level and we probe novel phenomena to push the boundaries of our understanding of **degenerate quantum gases (BEC)**.

We are a dynamic research group, at the [Laboratoire Kastler Brossel](http://www.lkb.upmc.fr). We explore synthetic photonic materials to answer **fundamental physics questions** on degenerare quantum gases and develop **innovative quantum technologies with light** (see [Research](research)).

**Job Offers:**
We are looking for talented new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
