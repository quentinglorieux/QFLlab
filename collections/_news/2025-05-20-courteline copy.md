## Outreach talk

With Clara Piekarski and Quentin Glorieux, we gave a talk to the students of the middle school Courteline in Paris XII. The talk was about the physics of light and its applications in metrology and quantum technologies. We showed liquid nitrogen experiments to illustrate the concept of temperature.
We  presented the work of scientists in the field of quantum technologies and we discussed the importance of science and technology in our daily lives insisting on the role of scientists in society.
