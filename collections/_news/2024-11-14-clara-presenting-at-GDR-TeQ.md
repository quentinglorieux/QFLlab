**Clara presents at GDR TeQ 2024**

Clara Piekarski, 3rd PhD in the group, presented her new results on two-component fluids of light at the [GDR TeQ conference](https://gdrteq2024.sciencesconf.org/) in Paris. Her research explores the 2 component fluid behavior, with the cool observation of spin and density modes speed of sound. 
Great audience, great talks, and great (vegetarian) food ! Thanks Hanna Le Jeannic and Anaïs Dréau for organizing this !
