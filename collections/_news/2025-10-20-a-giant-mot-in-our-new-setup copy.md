# A giant MOT in our new setup
Thanks to the hard work of our team, we have successfully implemented a giant Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) in our new experimental setup. This achievement marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in our new lab.

Next step: lets make non-linear optics and quantum fluids of light with cold atoms!

Congratulations to everyone involved in this project for their dedication and effort!

and all the support from the LKB quantum memory team (Julien, Alban and especially Felix !!) and the LKB technical team!
