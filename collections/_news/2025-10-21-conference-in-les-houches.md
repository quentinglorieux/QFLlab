The [Les Houches School on 'Quantum Metrology: From Optomechanics to Tests of Fundamental Physics'](https://leshouches2025-metrology.quantumoptics.fr) that Quentin Glorieux is organizing with Marion Delehaye is now open.

The first week is dedicated to foundational lectures covering ultracold atomic physics, atomic clocks, quantum squeezing, and optomechanics. In the following week, the school will focus on various aspects of quantum metrology, including precision measurements with quantum systems and their applications to fundamental physics.

Super cool group of speakers and participants:
