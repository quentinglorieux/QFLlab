Photons are great carriers of information but they usually donâ€™t interact with one another. Atoms interact but are hard to manipulate and do not benefit from the toolbox of quantum optics for detecting quantum fluctuations and entanglement.Many approaches have been proposed to marry these two systems for quantum simulation of condensed matter with strongly interacting photons, but to date, the realization of large-scale synthetic materials made of optical photons is still missing. Our team targets this exciting goal, namely the creation of **Synthetic Photonic Matter**. We are offering an internship opportunity (followed by an ERC-funded PhD) to expand the capabilities of this platform to a new level by increasing by many orders of magnitude the effective photon-photon interactions and enter the strong interaction regime.
