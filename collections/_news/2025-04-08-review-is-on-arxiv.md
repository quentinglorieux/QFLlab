## Our review paper is on arXiv
We are happy to announce that our review paper on **Paraxial fluids of light** is now available on arXiv.
It is a comprehensive overview of the field, including a detailed discussion of the theoretical framework and experimental realizations. We also provide an extensive list of references for further reading.
This is specifically designed for researchers who have a background in atomic quantum gases and are interested in the field of fluids of light. We hope that this review will help bridge the gap between these two communities and help collaboration.

The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06262) and will be publised in the Advances In Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics journal. 

Big thanks to all the authors for their hard work and to the editor Hélène Perrin for her support and careful proofreading.
