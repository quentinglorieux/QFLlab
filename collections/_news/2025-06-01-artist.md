## Artistic Collaboration with Ben Bogart

Recently, the artist [Ben Bogart](https://www.ekran.org/ben/wp/2024/revisit-of-fifth-sequence-apparatus-move-b/) visited our laboratory to document and creatively interpret our experimental apparatus through photography and image processing techniques.

His work captures not only the physical details of our setups but also brings an artistic perspective to the visual language of experimental physics. By exploring differences between image frames and stacking approaches, Benâ€™s images reveal new ways of seeing the dynamic aspects of our research environment.

We are grateful for this interdisciplinary exchange and look forward to further opportunities to blend art and science within our group.
