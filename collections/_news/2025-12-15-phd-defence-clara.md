## PhD defense — Clara Piekarski

Clara is now doctor! After Myrann on friday, Clara defended this monday, her thesis on  **“Binary mixtures of quantum fluids of light”**.

Well done and well deserved, congrats Clara!

#### Thesis summary

This thesis demonstrates the realization of a binary mixture of quantum fluids of light. Fluids of light rely on the mathematical mapping between the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which describes weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates, and the propagation of a laser through a nonlinear Kerr medium — in our case, a hot rubidium vapor. We can then study superfluidity, and more generally Bose gas physics, in a photonic system. In this work, we show that the two circular polarizations of light follow coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, and can therefore be considered as the two components of a binary Bose gas. We characterize the intra- and inter-component interactions and demonstrate the realization of a two-component fluid of light in the miscible and in the non-miscible regime. In the miscible regime, we proceed to the measurement of the elementary density and spin excitations, characteristic of a superfluid mixture. In the non-miscible regime, we prepare the fluid in a homogeneous mixture to study the spontaneous separation of the two components into domains, also called coarsening dynamics. We also show that the non-miscible binary fluid is a promising platform to study hydrodynamic instabilities at the interface between the two components.
