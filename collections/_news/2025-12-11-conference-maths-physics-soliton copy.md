## Presenting at Maths & Physics of Solitons 2025
Very nice workshop organized by Amandine Aftalion on [Maths & Physics of Solitons conference](https://solitons.sciencesconf.org/). Quentin is invited to speak about *Paraxial fluids of light: an experimental platform for nonlinear Schroedinger dynamics*.

The talk presents paraxial fluids of light - laser beams in nonlinear hot atomic vapors that realize a two-dimensional defocusing NLS where both density and phase are directly measurable. As usual, we will show that our platform enables quantitative studies of nonlinear structures such as Jones-Roberts solitons and their dipole-rarefaction-wave transitions, dispersive shock waves, leapfrogging vortex dynamics, vacuum points, limit cycles, and bifurcations.

These observations build a bridge between mathematical results on stability and modulation theory and the dynamics of a controllable physical system. 

#### Nice talk from our mathematicians colleagues!
