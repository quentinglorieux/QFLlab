# FOLIO Project: Fluids of Light in Hollow-Core Fiber Micro-Cells

**FOLIO** (Fluids Of Light in hollow-core fiber mIcrO-cells) is an ambitious research project coordinated by Quentin Glorieux. Running for 48 months, its goal is to **explore the exciting potential of creating and studying new states of light** through the development of an innovative fiber-based integrated device combining atoms and photonics.

## Background and Motivation

Photons are excellent information carriers but generally do not interact. Atoms do interact, but are more difficult to manipulate and lack the quantum optics toolbox for detecting quantum fluctuations and entanglement. Many approaches have been proposed to combine the two, and **fluids of light have emerged as promising candidates** to bridge the gap between quantum gases and quantum optics.

Current fluid-of-light platforms using semiconductor microcavities or dye-filled cavities are driven-dissipative, limiting their ability to generate new states of light to a narrow subset that is robust to losses. In 2018, the PIâ€™s group introduced an alternative approach based on the analogy between the **Gross-Pitaevskii equation** and the **paraxial propagation** of monochromatic light in a nonlinear medium (a rubidium vapor cell). This system features **low loss and tunable photon-photon interactions**.

However, these paraxial experiments are limited by short interaction lengths and weak nonlinearities. Moreover, cold atom and quantum optics labs require complex UHV setups, which are bulky and expensive.

## Goal and Novel Platform

FOLIO aims to overcome these limitations by developing a **new experimental platform** based on:
- **Custom-designed hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HCPCFs)**
- **Photonic Micro-cellsÂ® (PMC)**

This platform creates a **bridge between cold atom quantum gases and photonic systems**.

By inducing photon-photon interactions and confining light in low-dimensional geometries (1D and 2D), FOLIO will create **fluids of light** capable of undergoing phase transitions, forming vortices, or reaching complex molecular-like quantum states.

The FOLIO approach is based on two innovations:
1. Switching from glass vapor cells to **rubidium-filled HCPCFs**
2. Exploring new effects in a **long, tightly confined nonlinear medium**

HCPCFs serve both as micro-containers for alkali vapors and as optical waveguides with tailored mode content, enabling a **versatile and high-performance atomâ€“light coupling platform**. The system can be hermetically sealed to create a **Photonic Micro-cellÂ® (PMC)**, patented by GLOPhotonics.

## Consortium

FOLIO is a collaborative effort between three complementary partners:

- **Laboratoire Kastler Brossel (LKB)** â€“ Paris (academic): expertise in **quantum optics** and **fluids of light**. The PI Quentin Glorieux is based at LKB, alongside Prof. Alberto Bramati, an expert in quantum fluids.
- **GPPMM group** â€“ Limoges (academic): expertise in **atomic physics using HCPCFs**, led by Fetah Benabid. This team also developed anti-adsorption coatings for HCPCFs.
- **GLOPhotonics (GLO)** â€“ Industry partner specializing in **HCPCFs and Photonic Micro-cellsÂ®**, led by Devang Naik. Provides manufacturing and integration technologies.

The consortium is structured for **iterative feedback between experimental development, material design, and fundamental physics**.
