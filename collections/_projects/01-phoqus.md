# PhoQuS: Photons for Quantum Simulation



## Introduction

**PhoQuS** is a European research initiative funded under the Horizon 2020 FET Flagship program, aiming to pioneer a new platform for quantum simulation based on photonic quantum fluids.

Unlike traditional quantum simulators based on cold atoms or superconducting circuits, PhoQuS explores **light as a quantum fluid**, where photons interact and behave like particles in a superfluid. This approach enables the simulation of complex quantum systems using nonlinear optical effects that give rise to photon-photon interactions.

## Scientific Goals

- **Quantum superfluidity and turbulence**  
  Investigate quantum hydrodynamic effects such as superfluidity, turbulence, and quantized vortices in optical media.

- **Simulation of exotic quantum systems**  
  Reproduce phenomena such as:
  - Many-body localization  
  - Superfluid to Mott–insulator transitions  
  - Analog black holes and rotating spacetime  
  - Emergent gravitational-like behavior in light fluids

## Methodologies

PhoQuS utilizes several experimental platforms:

- **Photon fluids** in rubidium vapors and photorefractive crystals  
- **Polaritons** in semiconductor microcavities  
- **Photon BECs** in dye-filled cavities  
- **Trapped photon “bubbles”** in laser-cooled atoms

These systems are engineered with:
- Tailored potentials using spatial light modulators  
- Observation of flow patterns, quantized vortices, and collective excitations  
- Optical lattices for simulating strongly correlated systems

## Consortium

PhoQuS is coordinated by Prof. Alberto Bramati (Sorbonne Université) and includes partners from:

- France: SU, CNRS, Université Paris Diderot  
- UK: Imperial College London, University of Glasgow  
- Germany: University of Bonn  
- Italy: Sapienza, CNR  
- Portugal: Instituto Superior Técnico  

The team consists of both experimental and theoretical experts in quantum optics, condensed matter physics, and ultracold atomic systems.

## Outlook

PhoQuS aims to position **quantum fluids of light** as a novel, versatile platform for quantum simulation—advancing our understanding of quantum many-body physics and unlocking new directions in photonic quantum technologies.
