  **Quentin Glorieux** is a **Full Professor of Physics** at **Sorbonne University**, where he conducts experimental research in **quantum optics** and **quantum photonics** within the **Laboratoire Kastler Brossel (LKB)**.  
  His work explores the interface between **quantum fluids**, **nonlinear optics**, and **nanophotonics**, with the goal of understanding **collective phenomena of light** in complex media.

  He graduated as an engineer from the **Institut d’Optique Graduate School** and earned a **Master’s degree in Optics and Photonics** from **École Polytechnique** and **Institut d’Optique**.  
  He completed his **PhD in Physics (2010)** at **Université Paris Diderot** (now **Université Paris Cité**), in the **Laboratoire Matériaux et Phénomènes Quantiques** under the supervision of **Professor Thomas Coudreau**.  
  His doctoral work focused on **multimode quantum entanglement** generated by **four-wave mixing** in hot atomic vapors.

  Following his PhD, he joined the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA)** as a postdoctoral researcher in the **Laser Cooling and Trapping group** led by **William D. Phillips** and **Paul D. Lett**.  
  He was later awarded a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie International Outgoing Fellowship** to lead a project on **multimode quantum memories** involving **NIST**, the **Australian National University (Canberra)**, and the **University of Geneva** (*Nicolas Gisin’s group*).

  In **2013**, he joined **Université Pierre et Marie Curie** (now **Sorbonne University**) as **Associate Professor** and became a permanent member of **LKB**.  
  In **2014**, he received the **City of Paris “Emergences” Award**, supporting the creation of his independent experimental team.  
  His research developed along three main axes:  
  – **Nanophotonics**, studying light–matter coupling between quantum emitters and nanostructures such as tapered optical fibers;  
  – **Exciton-polariton systems**, investigating non-equilibrium quantum hydrodynamics and analog gravity;  
  – **Quantum fluids of light**, exploring optical superfluidity and out-of-equilibrium dynamics in atomic vapors.

  He was appointed **Junior Fellow of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF)** in **2018**, a distinction renewed in **2023** for a second five-year term.  
  In **2023**, he received a **European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant** for his project *MistiQ Light – Mott Insulator Phase Transition in a Quantum Fluid of Light*, and a **national ANR grant FOLIO** on quantum fluids in hollow-core fibers.

  **Quentin Glorieux** also serves on several **national and international scientific committees**, including the **Scientific Advisory Committee of EPJ Journals**, the **Open Science Committee of the French Physics Society**, and the **Administrative Board of the Institut Universitaire de France**.  
  He regularly lectures at the **Les Houches** and **Cargèse** schools on **quantum optics** and **quantum fluids**, and supervises an active group of **PhD and Master’s students** at **Sorbonne University**.

      I like running in the mountains (especially in Les Houches), climbing boulders and ice caves. I also enjoy photography and I am a big fan of the old school punk band NOFX.
