  After his engineering degree at Institut d’Optique and his Master degree at Ecole Polytechnique, Quentin Glorieux went to graduate school at the Paris Diderot University. In 2010, he earned a PhD in Quantum Optics at the laboratory Matériaux et Phénomènes Quantiques under the supervision of Pr Thomas Coudreau. During his PhD, he demonstrated the generation of multispatial mode entangled states using four-wave mixing in hot atomic vapors.

  In 2010, he joined Paul Lett’s group at NIST in Gaithersburg as a postdoctoral fellow in the Laser Cooling group directed by William Phillips. Quentin Glorieux was awarded a **Marie Curie European IOF fellowship** in 2011 to initiate a project on Multimode Quantum Memories with the NIST, the Australian National University and the group of Nicolas Gisin at University of Geneva. In September 2013, Quentin Glorieux has started a position of **Associate Professor at Sorbonne University in Paris** as a member of the Laboratoire Kastler Brossel (LKB). In 2015, Quentin Glorieux received the City of Paris Young Scientist "Emergences" Award which provides fundings to start an independent research group. Since then, he conducts two experimental activities on :

  - **Nanophotonics** : studying the coupling of single-photon emitters to nanostructures such as nanofiber
  - **Quantum fluid of light** : investigating superfluidity of light propagating in atomic media

  He has co-authored 59 publications in international peer reviewed journals (h=25, ~1900 citations) and 5 publications in international peer reviewed conference proceedings. In 2018 and 2023, he has been nominated **Junior Fellow** at the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF) from 2018 to 2028.|
  In 2022, he has been awarded an **ERC Consolidator Grant** to develop a new platform for quantum simulation with light.

      I like running in the mountains (especially in Les Houches), climbing boulders and ice caves. I also enjoy photography and I am a big fan of the old school punk band NOFX.
