  After his engineering degree at **Institut d’Optique** and his Master degree at École Polytechnique, Quentin Glorieux went to graduate school at Paris Diderot University. In 2010, he earned a PhD in Quantum Optics at the laboratory **Matériaux et Phénomènes Quantiques** under the supervision of **Prof. Thomas Coudreau**. During his PhD, he demonstrated the generation of multi-spatial mode entangled states using four-wave mixing in hot atomic vapors.|

  In 2010, he joined Paul Lett’s group at **NIST** (Gaithersburg, USA) as a postdoctoral fellow in the Laser Cooling group directed by William Phillips. Quentin Glorieux was awarded a Marie Curie European IOF fellowship in 2011 to initiate a project on multimode quantum memories in collaboration with NIST, the **Australian National University**, and the group of Nicolas Gisin at University of Geneva.|
  University in Paris, joining the **Laboratoire Kastler Brossel (LKB)**. In 2015, he received the City of Paris Young Scientist Emergences Award, which provided funding to start an independent research group. Since then, he has developed two experimental research directions:

  - **Nanophotonics** : studying the coupling of single-photon emitters to nanostructures such as nanofiber
  - **Quantum fluid of light** : investigating superfluidity of light propagating in atomic media

  In 2018 and again in 2023, he was nominated **Junior Fellow of the Institut Universitaire de France** (IUF).
  Since 2020, his main research focus has been on quantum fluids of light, supported by the **ERC Consolidator Grant** for the project “MistiQ Light”. This European funding enables the development of a new experimental platform for quantum simulation. The aim of the project is to observe **a quantum phase transition between a superfluid and a Mott insulator in a strongly interacting photon fluid**. This will open new perspectives on collective quantum effects of light and potential applications in photonic quantum technologies.

  He is author or co-author of 70 publications in international peer-reviewed journals, with an h-index of 27 and around 2000 citations. He has also contributed to 5 publications in international peer-reviewed conference proceedings.

      I like running in the mountains (especially in Les Houches), climbing boulders and ice caves. I also enjoy photography and I am a big fan of the old school punk band NOFX.
